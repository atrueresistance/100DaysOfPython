**Working Timer App**

This works with input a bit. It was really cool to see how pycharm informed me of an easier way to do the if statement.
Python I guess has what are called "chain" comparision operations. So instead of `if int(min) > 0 and int(min) <= 1440:` you can do this `if int(min) > 0 <= 1440:`.
Pretty cool thing to learn.
